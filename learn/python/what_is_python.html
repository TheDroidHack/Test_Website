      <h2>What is Python?</h2>
      <p>Python is a powerful, high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is designed to be
        simple and readable, which makes it a great choice for beginners in programming. Python can be used for a wide
        variety of tasks like web development, software development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is Python so Popular?</h3>
      <p>Python is popular for several reasons, including its simplicity, versatility, and large community. Here are
        some key reasons why Python is widely used:</p>

      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Simple and Easy to Learn:</strong> Python has a very clear and readable syntax, making it easy for
          beginners to pick up.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Python can be used for a wide range of applications, from building websites to
          analyzing data, and even creating games.</li>
        <li><strong>Large Community and Libraries:</strong> Python has a huge community and many libraries that allow
          you to do almost anything, from web development with frameworks like Django to machine learning with libraries
          like TensorFlow.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Python is platform-independent, meaning you can write Python code on one
          platform (e.g., Windows) and run it on another (e.g., macOS, Linux) without any issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Python is free to use, and its source code is open for anyone to contribute to
          or modify.</li>
        <li><strong>Supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Python allows you to use classes and objects to
          organize your code, making it easier to maintain and scale large applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Prototyping:</strong> Python is great for quickly testing ideas or building prototypes because
          of its simplicity and speed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where is Python Used?</h3>
      <p>Python is used in many areas, and its applications are constantly growing. Here are some common uses:</p>
      <ul class="usage-list">
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Python is used to build websites and web applications with frameworks like
          Django and Flask.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Science & Machine Learning:</strong> Python is the go-to language for analyzing data and
          building machine learning models using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Python is great for automating repetitive tasks like file handling, data entry,
          or web scraping.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Python can be used to create games using libraries like Pygame.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> Python is used to develop both desktop applications and back-end
          services.</li>
        <li><strong>IoT (Internet of Things):</strong> Python is used to program devices like Raspberry Pi for creating
          smart devices and automation tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Should Beginners Learn Python?</h3>
      <p>If you're new to programming, Python is an excellent starting point. Here's why:</p>
      <ul class="beginner-benefits">
        <li><strong>No Prior Knowledge Needed:</strong> Python's syntax is similar to English, making it easy to
          understand.</li>
        <li><strong>Plenty of Resources:</strong> There are many tutorials, videos, and communities to help you learn.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Immediate Results:</strong> You can start creating simple projects, like calculators or games, in no
          time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Python is like a magic tool – no matter what you want to build, it helps you do it easily and effectively.
        Whether you're a beginner or an expert, Python has something for everyone!</p>
