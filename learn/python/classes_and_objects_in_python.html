      <h2>Classes and Objects in Python</h2>

      <p>In Python, <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>objects</strong> are important parts of <strong>Object-Oriented
          Programming (OOP)</strong>.
        These concepts help us organize and structure our code in a more efficient way. Let's understand each of these
        concepts in simple terms:</p>

      <h3>What is a Class?</h3>
      <p>A <strong>class</strong> is like a blueprint or a template. It defines what an object will look like and what
        it can do.
        Think of it like a recipe to create objects with similar properties and behaviors. For example, if you want to
        create many car objects, you can define a <strong>Car</strong> class, which will describe what properties each
        car has, like its make (brand), model, and year.</p>

      <h4>Creating a Class</h4>
      <p>Here's an example of a simple class called <code>Car</code>:</p>
      <pre>
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
      
    def car_info(self):
        return f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Constructor (__init__):</strong> The method <code>__init__()</code> is a special function that is
          automatically called when a new object is created from the class. It helps initialize the attributes
          (properties) of the object. Here, it takes three parameters—<code>make</code>, <code>model</code>, and
          <code>year</code>—and sets them as the object's attributes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Attributes are the properties of the class. In our example, the car class has
          three attributes: <code>make</code> (the brand of the car), <code>model</code> (the specific model), and
          <code>year</code> (the year of manufacture).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Method:</strong> The <code>car_info()</code> method is a function inside the class that tells us
          about the car. It returns the details of the car, like the year, make, and model.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is an Object?</h3>
      <p>An <strong>object</strong> is a real instance of a class. Once we define a class, we can create multiple
        objects from it. Each object is like a specific instance of the blueprint, with its own unique values. For
        example, one object could represent a Toyota car, and another could represent a Honda car.</p>

      <h4>Creating an Object</h4>
      <p>Here’s how you can create objects from the <code>Car</code> class:</p>
      <pre>
# Creating car objects from the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2021)
      
# Using the car_info method to display details of the cars
print(car1.car_info())  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla
print(car2.car_info())  # Output: 2021 Honda Civic
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Here, we create two objects: <code>car1</code> and <code>car2</code>, using the <code>Car</code> class. For
          <code>car1</code>, we provide the make "Toyota", model "Corolla", and year 2020. For <code>car2</code>, we use
          "Honda", "Civic", and 2021.
        </li>
        <li>After creating the objects, we call the <code>car_info()</code> method for both objects to print the
          details. Each object has its own values for the attributes, so <code>car1.car_info()</code> prints the details
          of the first car, and <code>car2.car_info()</code> prints the details of the second car.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is the __init__ Method?</h3>
      <p>The <code>__init__()</code> method is a special method that is automatically called when you create an object.
        It is used to set up the object's initial state or attributes. Think of it like the setup process when you buy a
        new product and need to customize it for your use. In this case, the attributes are set during the creation of
        the object.</p>

      <p>In the <code>__init__()</code> method, the parameter <code>self</code> refers to the current object being
        created. This allows each object to have its own attributes.</p>

      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Initialize the dog's name
        self.age = age    # Initialize the dog's age
      
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"  # Return a bark sound with the dog's name
      
# Creating a dog object with the name 'Buddy' and age 3
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
      
# Using the bark method to display the dog's action
print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <code>__init__()</code> method sets the dog's name and age when a new dog object is created.</li>
        <li>We create an object <code>dog1</code> from the <code>Dog</code> class with the name "Buddy" and age 3.</li>
        <li>After that, we use the <code>bark()</code> method to make the dog say "Woof!" with its name.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Class Inheritance</h3>
      <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is a way to allow one class (child class) to use the properties and methods of
        another class (parent class). The child class can add its own features or even change (override) the behavior of
        the parent class methods.</p>

      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>
# Parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
      
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound."
      
# Child class inheriting from Animal class
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):  # Overriding the speak method of the Animal class
        return f"{self.name} barks."
      
# Creating a dog object
dog = Dog("Rex")
      
# Calling the speak method from the Dog class
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Rex barks.
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We have a parent class <code>Animal</code> with a method <code>speak()</code> that returns a generic sound
          for the animal.</li>
        <li>The <code>Dog</code> class is the child class that inherits from the <code>Animal</code> class. It can use
          the <code>speak()</code> method from the parent class, but it also overrides this method to make the dog bark
          instead of just making a generic sound.</li>
        <li>When we create an object of the Dog class and call <code>speak()</code>, it uses the overridden method to
          return "Rex barks."</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Class Methods and Static Methods</h3>
      <p>In Python, you can also define special types of methods within a class:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Class Methods:</strong> These methods work with the class itself, not individual objects, and are
          defined using the <code>@classmethod</code> decorator. They typically access or modify class-level attributes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Static Methods:</strong> These methods do not depend on the class or its objects. They are defined
          using the <code>@staticmethod</code> decorator and can be used like regular functions that don't need access
          to class or object data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>
class Person:
    count = 0  # This is a class attribute to keep track of how many people are created
      
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        Person.count += 1  # Every time a person is created, we increase the count
      
    @classmethod
    def get_count(cls):
        return f"Total people: {cls.count}"  # Accessing the class attribute count using cls
      
    @staticmethod
    def greet():
        return "Hello, welcome!"  # This is a static method, it doesn't depend on the class or object
      
# Creating person objects
person1 = Person("Alice")
person2 = Person("Bob")
      
# Calling class method to get the total count of people
print(Person.get_count())  # Output: Total people: 2
      
# Calling static method to greet
print(Person.greet())      # Output: Hello, welcome!
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the <code>Person</code> class, we have a class attribute <code>count</code> that tracks how many people
          have been created. Each time a new person object is created, the count is increased.</li>
        <li>The <code>get_count()</code> method is a class method that works with the class itself (not an object). It
          uses the <code>cls</code> parameter to access the class attribute <code>count</code> and returns the total
          number of people created.</li>
        <li>The <code>greet()</code> method is a static method. It doesn't depend on the class or any object; it's just
          a method that returns a greeting message.</li>
        <li>When we create two people objects (<code>person1</code> and <code>person2</code>), the class method
          <code>get_count()</code> tells us that there are 2 people. The static method <code>greet()</code> provides a
          general greeting message.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>A <strong>class</strong> is a blueprint, and an <strong>object</strong> is an instance of the class.
        With classes, you can reuse code and make your programs more structured and easy to manage.</p>
