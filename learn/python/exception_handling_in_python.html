      <h2>Exception Handling in Python</h2>

      <p>In Python, when errors occur during the execution of a program, these are called <strong>exceptions</strong>.
        Exception handling is a way to catch and deal with these errors gracefully so that the program doesn’t crash
        unexpectedly. It allows the program to keep running and provide meaningful messages instead of confusing errors.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Use Exception Handling?</h3>
      <p>Exception handling is very important because it helps the program handle unexpected situations without
        crashing. If we didn’t handle exceptions, the program would stop whenever an error occurs, and the user would
        see an ugly error message. Using exception handling helps us:</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Prevent program crashes:</strong> Catch errors and fix them so the program doesn’t stop working.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Improve user experience:</strong> Show helpful error messages to the user, instead of confusing
          crash messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Handle specific types of errors:</strong> Fix different kinds of errors in different ways, depending
          on the problem.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Basic Syntax of Exception Handling</h3>
      <p>In Python, the basic syntax for handling exceptions is done using the <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>
        blocks:</p>
      <pre>
try:
    # Code that might raise an error
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to handle the error
</pre>
      <p>Here's how it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <code>try</code> block contains the code that could cause an error.</li>
        <li>If an error occurs in the <code>try</code> block, Python jumps to the <code>except</code> block to handle
          it.</li>
        <li>The <code>ExceptionType</code> refers to the type of error you want to handle (like dividing by zero, wrong
          input, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common Types of Errors</h3>
      <p>Here are some common types of errors that you might encounter while programming:</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>ZeroDivisionError:</strong> This happens when you try to divide by zero (which isn’t allowed).</li>
        <li><strong>ValueError:</strong> This occurs when you pass a value of the correct type, but it’s not valid for
          the operation (e.g., trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer).</li>
        <li><strong>IndexError:</strong> This error occurs when you try to access an index in a list that doesn’t exist
          (like trying to access the 10th item in a list that has only 5 items).</li>
        <li><strong>TypeError:</strong> This happens when you try to perform an operation on the wrong data type (e.g.,
          adding a string to a number).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example 1: Handling Division by Zero</h3>
      <p>Let's look at an example where we try to divide by zero, which will normally cause an error. With exception
        handling, we can catch the error and display a friendly message instead of crashing:</p>
      <pre>
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
</pre>
      <p>In this example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The program asks the user to enter a number.</li>
        <li>If the user enters zero, Python will normally raise a <strong>ZeroDivisionError</strong> when it tries to
          divide by zero.</li>
        <li>But with the <code>except ZeroDivisionError</code> block, the program will show a friendly message saying
          "Error: Cannot divide by zero!" instead of crashing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example 2: Handling Multiple Exceptions</h3>
      <p>Sometimes you might want to handle different types of errors separately. You can use multiple
        <code>except</code> blocks for this. Let’s say you want to handle both <strong>ZeroDivisionError</strong> and
        <strong>ValueError</strong>:
      </p>
      <pre>
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.")
</pre>
      <p>In this case, if the user enters something that is not a number, a <strong>ValueError</strong> will be raised,
        and the program will display a different error message:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the user tries to divide by zero, it catches the <strong>ZeroDivisionError</strong> and shows "Error:
          Cannot divide by zero!".</li>
        <li>If the user enters a non-numeric value (like "abc"), it catches the <strong>ValueError</strong> and shows
          "Error: Invalid input! Please enter a valid number."</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Catching All Exceptions -->
      <h3>Example 3: Catching All Exceptions</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, you might not know which specific type of error could occur. In such cases, you can catch any error
        that occurs using a general <code>except</code> block. This approach is useful when you want to ensure that no
        error goes unhandled, but you don't know the exact error in advance.</p>

      <pre>
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
</pre>

      <p>In this example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The program tries to ask the user for a number and perform a division.</li>
        <li>If any error occurs (like entering a non-numeric value or dividing by zero), the <code>except</code> block
          will catch it.</li>
        <li>The message <code>An error occurred: {e}</code> is printed, where <code>{e}</code> shows the specific error
          message that occurred. This could be something like "invalid literal for int()" or "division by zero".</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Finally Block</h3>
      <p>The <code>finally</code> block is a special block of code that will always execute, no matter what happens in
        the <code>try</code> or <code>except</code> blocks. This is useful when you want to ensure certain actions are
        always performed, such as cleaning up resources, closing files, or closing network connections.</p>

      <pre>
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will always run, whether or not there was an error.")
</pre>

      <p>In this example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the user enters a valid number and no error occurs, the program will print the result of the division.
        </li>
        <li>If the user enters zero, a <strong>ZeroDivisionError</strong> is caught, and the message "Error: Cannot
          divide by zero!" will be shown.</li>
        <li>Regardless of whether an error occurs or not, the <code>finally</code> block will always run and print "This
          will always run, whether or not there was an error." This is useful for performing clean-up tasks that should
          happen no matter what.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Use Finally?</h3>
      <p>The <code>finally</code> block is often used to release resources that were acquired in the <code>try</code>
        block. For example, if you opened a file or a network connection in the <code>try</code> block, you should
        ensure that the file is closed or the connection is terminated in the <code>finally</code> block, even if an
        error occurs.</p>

      <h4>Example: Using Finally to Close a File</h4>
      <pre>
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found!")
finally:
    file.close()  # This will always run to close the file
    print("File is closed.")
</pre>
      <p>In this example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the file is found, it will be read and displayed. After that, the <code>finally</code> block ensures the
          file is closed.</li>
        <li>If the file is not found, a <strong>FileNotFoundError</strong> will be caught, and an error message will be
          shown, but the <code>finally</code> block will still execute, ensuring the file is closed if it was opened.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>In Python, exception handling allows you to manage errors and ensure your program continues to run smoothly
        even when something goes wrong. By using <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, and <code>finally</code> blocks,
        you can handle specific errors, give helpful messages to the user, and clean up after errors. Mastering
        exception handling is an essential skill for writing robust Python programs.</p>
