      <h2>History of Python</h2>
      <p>Python is a popular programming language that was created in the late 1980s and officially released in 1991.
        Despite its name, Python is not named after a snake but after a British comedy TV show called "Monty Python's
        Flying Circus."</p>

      <h3>How Did Python Start?</h3>
      <p>Python was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in 1989 while he was working at <strong>CWI (Centrum
          Wiskunde & Informatica)</strong> in the Netherlands. His goal was to build a programming language that:</p>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Simple and Readable:</strong> Easy to learn for beginners and capable of solving complex problems.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Could be used for various tasks, like web development, data analysis, and
          automation.</li>
        <li><strong>Powerful:</strong> Useful for advanced programming tasks as well.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Python Versions</h3>
      <p>Over the years, Python has evolved through multiple versions, becoming more efficient and feature-rich. Here
        are some key milestones in Python's journey:</p>
      <ul class="usage-list">
        <li><strong>Python 1.0 (1991):</strong> The first official release introduced core features like functions and
          exception handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Python 2.0 (2000):</strong> Added new features like garbage collection and Unicode support. However,
          support for Python 2 ended in 2020.</li>
        <li><strong>Python 3.0 (2008):</strong> A major update with modern syntax and features. While it wasnâ€™t
          backward-compatible with Python 2, it is the primary version used today.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why is Python Special?</h3>
      <p>Here are some reasons why Python is so popular:</p>
      <ul class="beginner-benefits">
        <li><strong>Human-Friendly Syntax:</strong> Python code looks similar to plain English, making it easy to
          understand.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Python has a massive community that helps beginners learn and grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Growth:</strong> Python is widely used in fields like AI, Machine Learning, and Web
          Development.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Today, Python is one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages, perfect for both beginners and
        experienced developers!</p>
