            <h2>Tools for Ethical Hacking</h2>
            <p>Ethical hackers use a variety of tools to test the security of systems, applications, and networks. These
                tools help in tasks like information gathering, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and
                post-exploitation analysis. Below, we'll explore some of the best tools available:</p>

            <h3>1. Reconnaissance Tools</h3>
            <p>These tools help hackers gather information about their targets. Think of them as your digital binoculars
                for spying on the "enemy."</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><b>Maltego:</b> A powerful tool for creating graphical representations of data relationships. Use it
                    to map out connections between people, domains, or IPs.</li>
                <li><b>Shodan:</b> Known as the "Google for Hackers," Shodan allows you to find devices connected to the
                    internet.</li>
                <li><b>Whois:</b> Use this command-line tool to gather domain registration details. It's like checking a
                    website’s birth certificate.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Identifying that a target company has multiple subdomains linked to a vulnerable
                    server.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Scanning Tools</h3>
            <p>Once reconnaissance is complete, you need to scan the target for vulnerabilities. These tools act like
                metal detectors, spotting open ports, weak services, and flaws.</p>
            <ul class="usage-list">
                <li><b>Nmap:</b> The OG of network scanning. Discover live hosts, open ports, and services running on a
                    target network.</li>
                <li><b>Nessus:</b> A vulnerability scanner that finds outdated software, weak configurations, and
                    exploitable issues.</li>
                <li><b>OpenVAS:</b> An open-source vulnerability scanner for comprehensive network analysis.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Using Nmap to find open SSH ports on a network running vulnerable firmware.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Exploitation Tools</h3>
            <p>Now comes the fun part – exploiting vulnerabilities. These tools are your digital lockpicks.</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><b>Metasploit:</b> A framework packed with exploits. If there’s a vulnerability, Metasploit probably
                    has an exploit for it.</li>
                <li><b>SQLmap:</b> Automates SQL injection attacks, allowing you to test database vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><b>John the Ripper:</b> A password-cracking tool. Think of it as a keymaker for locked digital
                    doors.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Using Metasploit to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability and gain access to a
                    target machine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Wireless Hacking Tools</h3>
            <p>These tools are used for testing WiFi security. Hackers love cracking weak wireless networks!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Aircrack-ng:</b> A suite for cracking WEP/WPA keys and testing WiFi network security.</li>
                <li><b>Kismet:</b> A network detector and packet sniffer for wireless LANs.</li>
                <li><b>Wireshark:</b> Captures and analyzes packets in real-time. It's like eavesdropping on a digital
                    conversation.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Using Aircrack-ng to crack a weak WPA-PSK key.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Web Application Hacking Tools</h3>
            <p>Web applications are prime targets for hackers. These tools help in testing their security.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Burp Suite:</b> An intercepting proxy for testing web application security, especially against
                    SQL injection or XSS attacks.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>6. Post-Exploitation Tools</h3>
            <p>Once access is gained, these tools help hackers maintain persistence and analyze the impact of their
                breach.</p>
            <ul>

                <li><b>Example:</b> Using Mimikatz to extract admin credentials from a compromised machine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Forensics and Reverse Engineering Tools</h3>
            <p>These tools are used for analyzing malware and understanding how attacks happen.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>IDA Pro:</b> A disassembler for reverse engineering malware.</li>
