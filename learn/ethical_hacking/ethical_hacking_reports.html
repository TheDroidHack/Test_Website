            <h2>Ethical Hacking Report</h2>
            <p>An ethical hacking report is a comprehensive document that outlines the results of a penetration test or
                security assessment. This report aims to highlight vulnerabilities found during testing, categorize
                their severity, and recommend fixes to strengthen the security posture of an organization.</p>

            <h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>The Executive Summary serves as a high-level overview of the ethical hacking engagement. This section is
                aimed at both technical and non-technical stakeholders and summarizes the most important aspects of the
                test.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Objective:</b> A short statement on why the ethical hacking was conducted. For example: "To
                    identify and fix security vulnerabilities in the internal network and web applications."</li>
                <li><b>Scope:</b> Details about which systems, applications, or networks were included in the test.</li>
                <li><b>Key Findings:</b> A summary of the most significant vulnerabilities found and an assessment of
                    the overall security posture.</li>
                <li><b>Recommendations:</b> A list of the critical steps that should be taken to address identified
                    vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Methodology</h3>
            <p>This section outlines the approach and steps taken during the penetration test, as well as the tools
                used. Here’s a brief example of a common ethical hacking methodology:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Reconnaissance (Information Gathering):</b> During this phase, information was gathered passively
                    (without alerting the target) and actively (using various tools). Data was collected from public
                    sources, domain names, IP addresses, and network infrastructure.</li>
                <li><b>Scanning:</b> Tools like Nmap were used to identify open ports, services running on them, and
                    potential vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><b>Exploitation:</b> After identifying vulnerabilities, controlled exploitation attempts were made
                    to see how deeply an attacker could gain access.</li>
                <li><b>Post-Exploitation:</b> After gaining access, further actions were taken to assess whether
                    attackers could maintain access and move laterally through the network.</li>
                <li><b>Reporting:</b> Detailed documentation of all findings, actions, and results for transparency and
                    further review.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Findings</h3>
            <p>In this section, the specific vulnerabilities discovered during testing are listed. For each
                vulnerability, the following information should be provided:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Vulnerability Name:</b> The name or type of vulnerability found (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site
                    Scripting (XSS), Privilege Escalation).</li>
                <li><b>Description:</b> A clear explanation of the vulnerability and how it was identified.</li>
                <li><b>Risk Level:</b> Categorization of the vulnerability's severity, typically ranked as High, Medium,
                    or Low.</li>
                <li><b>Impact:</b> What an attacker could potentially achieve by exploiting the vulnerability, such as
                    unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruption.</li>
                <li><b>Evidence:</b> Provide screenshots, logs, or other artifacts that prove the existence of the
                    vulnerability.</li>
                <li><b>Reproduction Steps:</b> If applicable, provide detailed steps on how to reproduce the
                    vulnerability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Recommendations</h3>
            <p>For each vulnerability found, recommendations are provided to fix or mitigate the issue. These should be
                prioritized based on the severity and potential impact.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Patch or Update Software:</b> Apply patches or updates to vulnerable software to close security
                    gaps.</li>
                <li><b>Implement Security Controls:</b> Suggest adding firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems
                    (IDS/IPS), and access management mechanisms to protect systems.</li>
                <li><b>Code Review and Hardening:</b> For web applications, suggest performing a code review to
                    eliminate common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</li>
                <li><b>Training and Awareness:</b> Advise on providing security training for employees, especially about
                    recognizing phishing and social engineering attacks.</li>
                <li><b>Regular Security Audits:</b> Recommend performing regular security assessments and penetration
                    tests to proactively identify and fix emerging vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The conclusion of the report summarizes the security posture of the organization based on the findings
                from the engagement. It reinforces the importance of addressing vulnerabilities promptly and highlights
                the positive steps being taken to reduce risk.</p>

            <h3>6. Appendices</h3>
            <p>The appendices contain any additional information that supports the findings and recommendations in the
                main body of the report. This can include full scan results, screenshots, scripts, or tools used during
                the engagement.</p>
