            <h2>Ethical Hacking Methodology</h2>
            <p>Ethical hacking is a structured process used to test and secure computer systems. The goal is to think
                and act like a hacker but with permission and a clear conscience. Below is a step-by-step guide to how
                ethical hackers operate.</p>

            <h3>1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)</h3>
            <p>This is the first phase, also known as <b>footprinting</b>. Here, the ethical hacker collects as much
                information as possible about the target system. It’s like preparing for a heist by learning the layout
                of the building.</p>
            <p><b>Tools and Techniques:</b></p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><b>OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):</b> Using publicly available data like WHOIS, DNS records, and
                    social media.</li>
                <li><b>Scanning Tools:</b> Tools like <b>Maltego</b> and <b>Recon-ng</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Searching for employee email addresses on LinkedIn to plan a phishing attack.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Scanning and Enumeration</h3>
            <p>In this phase, hackers probe the network to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. Think of
                it as knocking on every door and window of a building to see which ones are unlocked.</p>
            <p><b>Techniques:</b></p>
            <ul class="usage-list">
                <li><b>Network Scanning:</b> Using tools like <b>nmap</b> or <b>Angry IP Scanner</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Enumeration:</b> Extracting usernames, shared resources, or details about the operating system
                    using tools like <b>Netcat</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Finding an outdated FTP service running on port 21 that can be exploited.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
            <p>This involves identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities in the system. Ethical hackers use automated
                tools and manual analysis to spot weak points.</p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> <b>Nessus</b>, <b>OpenVAS</b>, and <b>Qualys</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> Discovering a SQL injection vulnerability in a login form.</p>

            <h3>4. Exploitation (Gaining Access)</h3>
            <p>Now comes the exciting (and dangerous) part: exploiting the identified vulnerabilities to gain
                unauthorized access. Don’t worry, ethical hackers have permission to break things—for testing purposes!
            </p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> <b>Metasploit</b>, custom scripts, and payloads.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> Using a buffer overflow exploit to gain administrative privileges on a server.</p>

            <h3>5. Post-Exploitation</h3>
            <p>After gaining access, ethical hackers analyze the extent of the breach and assess the potential impact.
                It’s like an intruder checking out every room of the house after breaking in.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Tasks:</b> Dumping passwords, extracting sensitive files, and exploring internal networks.</li>
                <li><b>Example:</b> Using tools like <b>Mimikatz</b> to extract password hashes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Privilege Escalation</h3>
            <p>This phase involves escalating privileges to gain higher access, such as moving from a standard user to
                an admin. It’s like finding the keys to the boss’s office.</p>
            <p><b>Techniques:</b> Exploiting misconfigurations, unpatched software, or weak credentials.</p>

            <h3>7. Maintaining Access</h3>
            <p>Ethical hackers often plant backdoors or persistent mechanisms to re-enter the system if needed for
                further testing. But don’t worry—this access is removed after the testing is complete.</p>
            <p><b>Example:</b> Installing a backdoor using <b>Netcat</b> for remote access during a pentest.</p>

            <h3>8. Reporting</h3>
            <p>The final phase is documenting everything discovered during the test. The ethical hacker provides a
                detailed report to the client with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Findings:</b> What vulnerabilities were found and how they were exploited.</li>
                <li><b>Recommendations:</b> Steps to fix the vulnerabilities and improve security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This phase is where the superhero’s job ends—handing over the map to secure the kingdom!</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Ethical Hacking Methodology is like a treasure hunt for vulnerabilities, but instead of taking the
                gold, ethical hackers help protect it. Whether it’s scanning networks, breaking into systems, or writing
                reports, the ultimate goal is to make systems safer for everyone.</p>
